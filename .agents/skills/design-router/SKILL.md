description: Router for 67 bundled design themes. Use whenever building or restyling UI and a visual direction is needed — it maps the desired vibe (minimal, playful, retro, enterprise, glassmorphism, etc.) to the right theme file to load. Trigger on "design style", "make it look...", "UI theme", "visual direction", or any request to build a page/app with a specific aesthetic.

# Design Skill Router

This skill bundles 67 design themes from typeui.sh. Each theme lives in
`themes/<slug>.md` (relative to this SKILL.md) and contains a full design
system: tokens, typography, spacing, component rules, quality gates, and
design intent.

## How to use this router

1. Identify the desired visual direction from the user's request (explicit style name, adjectives, product type, or references).
2. Pick ONE theme from the catalog below. If ambiguous, ask the user or default to `clean` for apps and `modern` for marketing sites.
3. Read `themes/<slug>.md` in this skill's folder and follow it as the design system for all UI you generate.
4. Do not mix multiple themes in one project unless the user asks.

If the user names a style that matches a slug exactly (e.g. "neobrutalism", "glassmorphism"), skip the catalog and load `themes/<slug>.md` directly.
